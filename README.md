# Wiske

Wiske (pronounced /ˈwɪskə/) is a synthesizer written in Python, for use in Python programmes.

It is still in early development, but can already play, to some degree, soundfonts in the sf2 format.

Wiske currently only supports Linux, but I hope to target Windows and Mac as well in the future.

Wiske originated as a synthesizer for sister-project [Tabby](https://github.com/jthistle/tabby), an ASCII guitar tab editor.

## Structure

The main module is in `/wiske`.

A couple of demos/manual tests are in the root directory as `sf_test*.py`.

## Docs

There are none! There will be some!
